# Choc button caps
These are a set of 24mm and 30mm buttons caps in different styles for Kailh Choc V1 and V2 low profile mechanical switches. The V2's are also MX stem compatible.

Variants:
- Flat
- Convex
- Concave - The height of these needs to be adjusted slightly as they feel a little weak around the stems

Materials:
- The flat caps can be FDM printed and I will update this when the others have been tested.
- All caps have been tested successfully with MJF.
